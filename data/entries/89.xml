    <title>Search and Sort <em>Foreign Relations</em> Documents by Date</title>
    <body>The most frequently requested feature by users of the Office of the Historian website is
        now here: Readers can search the <em>Foreign Relations</em> series by date and sort search
        results chronologically. The new search interface allows users to leverage a combination of
        keywords, date ranges, and volume-based filtering to enhance their <em>FRUS</em> research
        experience. These features have been released at an early “alpha” stage of development to
        gather feedback.</body>
