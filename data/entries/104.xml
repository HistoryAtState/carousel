    <title>Now Available: <em>Foreign Relations of the United States</em>, 1977-1980, Volume XII,
        Afghanistan</title>
    <body>This volume is part of a <em>Foreign Relations</em> subseries that documents the most important
        foreign policy issues of the Jimmy Carter administration. The focus of this volume is on the
        Carter administration’s approach to events in Afghanistan during the buildup of the Soviet
        Union’s presence in that country beginning in early 1978 and culminating in the large scale
        invasion of Soviet troops at the end of 1979. Officials in the Carter administration
        regarded Soviet actions as among the most flagrant violations of international norms during
        the Cold War. The volume is arranged chronologically, with the majority of documents
        concentrated around the crisis period during the lead-up to the invasion, and during the
        aftermath, when the Carter administration formulated a range of policy responses to
        challenge the Soviet Union’s domination of Afghanistan. </body>
